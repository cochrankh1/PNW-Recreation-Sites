A few years ago I moved out to Oregon with no knowledge of BLM recreation sites and public free camping. That quickly changed when someone introduced me to the idea and educated me on the concept. This opened up endless possibility for traveling throughout the PNW in my van, camping for free in some of the most beautiful public lands I have ever seen. I then found out about all the different phone apps that were developed for camping on public lands. That is what inspired me to create this map.

The major functions of this map are the the locations of individual BLM recreation site points indicated by the different color tent icons. When you click on them, a pop up labels what kind of site it is (Campsite, Trailhead, other). Then when you zoom in on the map you will see that there is a background layer indicating how concentrated the sites are in each county. Looking at the legend you will notice that the concentration of recreation sites is indicated by the shade of purple. These shades of purple have a range of total sites for each county. 

I sourced the data for BLM National Recreation Site Points from data.gov, downloaded the csv file so I could open it in excel and filter the data to just recreation sites in Oregon. When I uploaded the filtered data into geojson.io, I noticed that there were a lot of sites in Washington that were administed by the state of Oregon. I sourced the county boundary data from GEOHub Data and noticed that the Oregon counties data file also included Washington counties as well, so I decided to keep all of the Washington recreation sites and county boundaries in the project. 

Time to explore the PNW!
